A small CSS project utilising everything that has been taught until now.

HTML and CSS are used here.

git and github are used

Hope that i didnot butcher the project.

Used alot of Div and flex properties.

Margin and padding where the main item.

Took a long time to this project.

Any and all criticism are welcome.

And any suggestion to simplify the codes are much appreciated since i think the codes can be more simplified.
